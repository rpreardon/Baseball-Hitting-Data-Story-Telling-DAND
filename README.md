# Baseball-Hitting-Data-Story-Telling-DAND
- This is a project from the Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity
- The purpose was to create data story using Tableau
- For this project:
  - I used a tidy data set provided by udacity on baseball hitting statistics; this data set only showed batters names, hitting stances, batting averages and homeruns, so kind of limited in the hitting category
  - I added a BMI calculation and classification and saved the data set with the new categories using a jupyter notebook
  - Created a data story using the new data set in tableau
- I received feedback from others to improve my data story and resubmitted

#### Fun project to practice tableau visualizations
